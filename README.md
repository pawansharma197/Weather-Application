Now Why To get data From API or Why to use API? 

ANS : APIs are needed to bring applications together in order to perform a designed function built around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes. They work as the middle man, allowing developers to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses use on a daily basis.


AZURE service used :- WEB APP

Explanation :- Azure Web Apps are Microsoft's offering to cloud to host web applications. It allows developers to focus on delivering business values rather than consuming time on Sever updates or OS patches. Interestingly, applications built on Java, PHP, Python or Node. js can also be deployed on web apps.
